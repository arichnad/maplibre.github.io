However, since MapLibre is a TypeScript library in the same spirit, if you wish to use some of the popular Mapbox plugins in your TypeScript application you will likely run into the TypeScript compiler throwing a lot of type inference errors.</description></item><item><title>Bart Louwers starts as Maintainer Native</title><link>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-01-03-announcement-bart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-01-03-announcement-bart/</guid><description>Today, Bart Louwers is starting to work with MapLibre in the Maintainer Native role.
